# linux-checklist-2021
A checklist for Cyberpatriot teams created for Ubuntu18.04/20.04

## Notes
If a command errors or fails, try it again with `sudo`

Google anything and everything. If you don't know or understand something, google it.

When you see the syntax `$word`, do not type it verbatim, but instead substitute the appropriate word (usually referenced in a previous command).

### Ways to open files:
I personally use gedit which is a graphical interface, but many people use vim or nano which are terminal based.

For editing some files such as those in /etc/ `sudo` will need to be used.

## Checklist

1. Read the Readme

	You always want to do this first, as it gives importaint user information and required services.
  
	
2. Work on Forensic Questions
	
	These are essential to do second, as doing later steps often destroys needed information or data.
